# Makma2
This is the repository for the Makma2-project. It will be a rendering engine for 2D graphics, optimised for old-school, top-down, text-conversation 2D games. However, unlike old engines, will the Makma2 feature more complex graphics, like basic lighting on 2D maps, advanced particles or modern graphics effects.

## Installation
To compile the project, make sure that you have the following libraries installed somewhere on your computer:
  - Vulkan (graphics library)
  - GLFW3 (window library)
Then, 

## Usage
Once installed and compiled, the engine can be used as a normal C++-style library to develop games with. One example of such a game (and that is used to test this library) can be found here.

## Issues
If you have any suggestions, issues or want to report a bug, feel free to leave an issue here in this repository. If you do, please mark it with the appropriate tags so that we can find it.
